Glide is a lightweight carousel full details here https://glidejs.com/


# Files

markup = This is a react component, but you can copy the html and place where you want a carousel.

glideInitialisation = This initialises glide with paramaters passed in, these are all on the website above and just passed into the "new Glide" if you don't want the bullet points you can remove the html in the markup.

Make sure you pass in your parent element, this will allow it to be unique on the page and allow more glide placements.

## Styles

The styles are automatically pissed from glide.
