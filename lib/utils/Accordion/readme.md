# Accordion

So this won't work straight out the box, this is just skeletons to help you adapt.


# Files

accordionTrigger.js = This function will add the ability to slide up and down when clicked, this is all the functionality behind making an accordion work.

SlideToggle =  Created this to mock the jQuery "slideUp/slideDown" in pure js.

markUp = This is a react component so won't work and you'll have to copy and paste, but it's a general idea on how you can get it to work, it can take in prams data, which can be either just text or a block of images. But this can be stripped out and below the "rte" class you can just add what ever you want your content to be

## Styles

There's no styles attached as these can differ from each site, the classes can be used ofc or changed, just be careful as the accordionTrigger uses a few of the classes, so make sure to match.
