<h4>Basis of Access and Responsibility</h4>

    pursuant to the possible transaction or otherwise in any jurisdiction in which such offer, invitation or

<h4>Overseas Persons</h4>
<p>
    Viewing the materials you seek to access may be unlawful if you are resident in a Restricted Jurisdiction. In
    certain
    jurisdictions, including Restricted Jurisdictions, only certain categories of person may be allowed to view such
    materials.
</p>
<p>
    Any person who wishes to view these materials must first satisfy themselves that they are not subject to any local
    requirements that prohibit or restrict them from doing so and should inform themselves of, and observe, any
    applicable legal or regulatory requirements applicable in their jurisdiction. Any failure to comply with
    restrictions
    may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not permitted to view materials on this Microsite please exit this Microsite. Should you be in any doubt
    about whether you are permitted to view materials on this Microsite, you should not access the Microsite and you
    should take legal advice. No responsibility is accepted for any violation by any person of these restrictions.
</p>
<p>
    Copies of the contents of the following pages (including documents posted thereon) are not being, and must not
    be, released or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by any means

</p>
<h4>Notice to US Investors</h4>
<p>The Possible Acquisition is subject to disclosure and procedural requirements of the United Kingdom which are
    different from those in the United States. Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission, nor any securities
    commission of any state of the United States has approved the Possible Acquisition, passed upon the fairness of
    the Possible Acquisition or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of any information in this section of the website.
    Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.</p>
<p>The financial information included in certain documents contained in this Microsite has been prepared in
    accordance with non-US accounting standards, and thus may not be comparable to financial information of US
    companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles in the United States.</p>
<p>It may be difficult for US holders of shares to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal
    securities
    laws. Holders in the United States may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-
    US court for violations of US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its
    affiliates to subject themselves to a US court’s judgment.</p>
<h4>Forward-Looking Statements</h4>
<p>This Microsite, including any information included or incorporated by reference, may contain certain forward-looking
    statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of the parties to the
    Possible
    Acquisition. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are
    forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the current expectation of the management of that
    company and are naturally subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These forward-looking statements
    may be identified by words such as "will", "may", "should", "could", "would", "can", "believes", "intends",
    "expects",
    "indicates", “aims”, "anticipates" or similar words or terms or by discussions of, inter alia, strategies, goals or
    plans.</p>
<p>By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend
    on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. There are several factors which could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. The factors include, but
    are not limited to, changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces,
    future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or dispositions. Due to
    such uncertainties, no assurance can be given that any forward-looking statement will prove to be correct in the
    future.</p>
<p>The forward-looking statements contained in this Microsite are based on numerous assumptions and assessments
    made in light of the relevant party’s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business
    strategies, operating environment, future developments and other factors considered appropriate. Although it is
    believed that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be
    given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this Microsite are therefore
    cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as at the date of the
    relevant document or announcement reproduced on this Microsite. Hotel Chocolat expressly disclaims any
    obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or
    developments, except as required by law.</p>
<p>Unless expressly stated otherwise, no statement in this Microsite is intended to constitute a profit forecast or
    profit
    estimate for any period and no statement should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share will necessarily
    be greater or lesser than those for the relevant preceding financial periods for the relevant party to the Possible
    Acquisition.</p>
