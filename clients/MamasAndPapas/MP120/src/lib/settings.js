        We've always been big fans of the Ocarro pushchair, but it's fair to say we're more than 
        a little biased. However, following Which?'s recent testing, we're very proud to say that the 
        Ocarro achieved an amazing score of 79%, with Which? singling out praise for its 
        'genuinely great features'.

        Here are some other lovely things they've said:

      <em>
        "The Ocarro is a Best Buy, thanks to a host of useful features combined with a great drive. 
        The chunky all-terrain tyres won't let you down whether you're on grass, a car park or just 
        sticking to pavements. It really is the pushchair to take with you wherever you want to go."

        Which? tested the Armadillo and all its many features, and it came out with an incredible 84%. 
        Which? said the Armadillo is "a great overall stroller and a good choice if you're not sold on 
        the idea of a bulky travel system." They even went on to say:

    <p>
      <em>
        "The Mamas and Papas Armadillo is a great stroller that's practical, easy to use every day 
        and a good all-round pushchair."

        "The Ocarro is a gorgeous pushchair, super stylish and well made. Itâ€™s so easy to use in any mode, 
        from popping on the carrycot to changing it to the pushchair, and the option to face the world or 
        face mummy is an effortless transition that literally takes just seconds.

        The shopping basket is a huge asset, very much with the emphasis on "huge". With two little ones I 
        carry "everything but the kitchen sink" with me, but there was still plenty of room for our shopping.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>
        Our short answer to what we think of the Ocarro is that we love it for its ease of use, excellent 
        manoeuvrability and the fact it looks great is, of course, an added bonus. I'd highly recommend it!
