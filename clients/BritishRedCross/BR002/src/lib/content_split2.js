          <p>After a surge of violence in Myanmar, over 700,000 people have been forced to flee their homes with nothing. </p>
          <p>Families endured treacherous journeys, and many lost loved ones along the way.</p>
          <p>Those who survived are now living in the world’s largest refugee camp, much of which was destroyed in the recent monsoon season. </p>
          <p>On the ground, the Red Cross has been racing against the clock to help provide people with safe and dignified shelter and living conditions.</p>
          <p>354 latrines and 222 hygiene facilities have been constructed. </p>
          <p>Abdullah is in charge of hygiene safety for the British Red Cross .  He is proud of what he’s been doing to support his own community, and is making good use of his skills, but he dreams of returning home.</p>
          <p>The Red Cross is on the ground providing vital aid and medical support but needs remain desperate, and we still urgently need your help.</p>
          <p><strong>Please donate today.</strong></p>

          <p><em>“We need safety. You can even survive without food, but the most important thing is safety,"</em> said Christina.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The people of South Sudan have not felt safe for over three years. Now millions are struggling to survive. <em>"When the violence started I came to the Red Cross compound with my little daughter. We still can’t return home,”</em> said Christina.</p>
          <p>Four years of conflict have forced more than 4.3 million people to flee their homes. Many families are barely surviving without food, shelter or clean water.</p>
          <p>Heavy rains have made the suffering worse. Harvests continue to fail. The threat of disease is high. There has been a recent outbreak of cholera that will escalate if conditions do not improve.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The situation is desperate.</p>
