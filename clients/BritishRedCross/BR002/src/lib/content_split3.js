          <p>In a crisis, the Red Cross is a sign of hope. Whether someone is struggling to cope at home after a hospital stay, needs to borrow a wheelchair or feels alone and isolated, the British Red Cross is there.</p>
          <p><strong>And that’s all thanks to you. We rely on simple acts of kindness like yours to provide support across the UK.</strong></p>
          <p>Make a donation today and you will bring comfort to someone when they need it most. Your generosity will help give more people access to our UK services. People like Andy, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer and had no one to turn to after being discharged from hospital. <i> "I was in crisis. I couldn't speak, I couldn't move. I was on my own." </i> said Andy. It wasn't until he met Ian, his British Red Cross volunteer, that he was given a lifeline.</p>
          <p>There is someone in the UK who needs you today. Your donation can change their life.</p>
          <p><strong>Please donate now to help make sure support is there for those who need it most.</strong></p>

          <p>On Monday 22 May, 22 people were tragically killed and dozens more injured after a bomb exploded at the Manchester Arena. Many of them were children.</p>
          <p>Manchester City Council has launched the We Love Manchester emergency fund, an appeal in partnership with the British Red Cross, to support those affected by the attack and their families. </p>
          <p> The Manchester Evening News, who launched the We Stand Together appeal raising £1m, have joined forces with the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund.</p>
          <p><strong>Please donate now to help those bereaved or injured. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In the aftermath of the attack, we saw people coming together, supporting and helping each other. Red Cross volunteers are offering emotional support to affected families.</p>
          <p>You can show the people of Manchester they are not alone by donating today. </p>
          <p>The Lord Mayor of Manchester, Councillor Eddy Newman, said: "The We Love Manchester Emergency Fund has been established to swiftly provide funds to the families of victims of the attack at the Manchester Arena, to help them to cope at this incredibly difficult time.”</p>
