          <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span>Across the world, millions of people face a terrible choice: live in a war zone and hope for the best or run for their lives to somewhere safer.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span>But settling into a new country is not easy, and this is often made more difficult for people who are unfamiliar with the language, or are separated from family and friends.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span>You can help. From providing vital aid along their journey to language classes and befriending projects in a new country, your support will help refugees around the world rebuild their lives in safety.</span></p>

          <p>Since 2014 the devastating violence in Iraq has forced over three million people to leave their homes in search of safety.</p>
          <p>One father described his family’s grim escape from the fighting in Mosul. They fled their home and walked miles to a refugee camp:</p>
          <p><em>“We were trembling all night from the cold. We have a young baby. She doesn’t have milk and we carried her all the way. She was crying the whole night.”</em></p>
          <p>This family were lucky – they escaped the conflict. But every month the crisis continues across Iraq. And every month more families are running for their lives, struggling to survive.</p>
          <p>More than ten million people desperately need our help today.</p>
          <p>Please donate now.</p>

          <p>Ashe is 20 years old. She cradles her two-year-old daughter,  little Amahani who has been sick for more than a month.
          </p>
          <p>Conflict, food shortages and disease have created a devastating humanitarian crisis across Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad.
          </p>
          <p>Thousands of families like Ashe’s have been forced to flee their homes, leaving everything behind. Living in camps, they struggle to survive. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Every day, a child like Amahani dies of malnutrition.
          </p>
          <p>Your donation today will help provide desperately needed food, water and medicine.</p>
          <p>
