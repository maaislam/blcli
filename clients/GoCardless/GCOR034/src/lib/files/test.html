                    <div class="content-body01 content-body">
                        <p>GoCardless lets businesses easily collect payments online, directly from your customers' bank
                            accounts (rather than using expensive card networks). Bank payments are a pull payment
                            method, putting the business in control of triggering the payment. The customer just needs
                            to
                            authorise it one time, and the job is done.</p>
                        <p>You can use GoCardless to set up automated and recurring
                            payments using Direct Debit. You can also collect collect instant, one-off payments.</p>
                        <p>All of our payment processing uses bank payments. Leaving cards behind means you enjoy lower
                            fees, easy
                            automation, and reduced payment failures, saving you time, stress, and money.</p>
