export const aboutSalonsHTML = `<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We founded Salons Direct as a husband and wife home-run mail order company to the professional hair and beauty industry in 1992, and to this day we are proud to say that our company still remains very much a family business with customer’s interests close to our heart.</p>
<p>We are 100% committed to supplying great products at value for money (just check out our feefo page if you don't believe us!)  and believe our fast delivery service, permanent special offers and excellent customer service makes us stand out a mile from our competition!</p>
<p>In 2003 our 2 daughters Danielle and Gemma joined us as Marketing Directors, and our son in law Graham joined us in 2008 as an Operations Director.  We now have over 80 members of staff working for us across all departments, and despite the growth that we have experienced we still maintain our core family values and customer-focused philosophy.</p>
<p>In July 2017 we celebrated our 26th birthday, an incredible milestone for the company that started life with a 16 page mail-order brochure!  We now produce a 580 page hairdressing and beauty catalogue each year, and our website sells over 10,000 different items!</p>
<p>We are based in Bromborough on the Wirral and have a huge distribution centre, a friendly customer service team, a cool & very creative marketing and design department, and of course a flagship superstore and furniture showroom.</p>
