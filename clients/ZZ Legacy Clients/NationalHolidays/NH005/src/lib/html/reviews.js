                National Holidays are really good value for money. Coaches are clean and comfortable and the drivers are all friendly and helpful. I have been on a number of National Holidays over the years and cannot fault them.

                This was our first coach trip and I cant lie I was dreading the bus side of the trip... however once we met our driver Jason I couldn't have been any more wrong..such a lovely funny man. He really went the extra mile to make kids laugh. He's definitley what you need on a long journey.

                Just got back from a 3 day Edinburgh trip. Couldn't fault the trip, lovely hotel. Plenty of time to have a good look around the city. Drivers Paul and Chris were very friendly and funny and very informative about the area. Always great value for money with National.

                Returned Saturday from Donegal, tour was great and we had a lovely driver Steve who was very helpful and knowledgeable about places we visited. All the hotels we stayed at were first class and I hope to do the same holiday next year.
